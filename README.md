# Disease Trend Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes disease trends from 2020 to 2022, focusing on:

- The **top 5 diseases** with the highest cases over time.
- The **top 10 diseases** by incidence rate in 2022.
- A **heatmap visualization** showing cases per year.

The goal is to uncover patterns, identify health concerns, and provide a data-driven approach to public health insights.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes yearly disease cases from 2020 to 2022. Key features:

- **Disease**: Name of the disease.
- **2020, 2021, 2022**: Number of cases per year.
- **Grand Total**: Total cases (removed from analysis for accuracy).
- **Incidence Rate**: Number of cases per 100,000 population (used for ranking diseases in 2022).

## 🔍 Key Insights

### **1️⃣ Top 5 Diseases Trend (2020-2022)**

- The trend analysis shows how the most common diseases evolved over the years.
- Some diseases show a **steady increase**, while others **declined** due to health interventions.

### **3️⃣ Heatmap - Cases per Year**

- The heatmap helps visualize which diseases consistently have high cases.
- Sudden **spikes or declines** may indicate outbreaks or successful interventions.
